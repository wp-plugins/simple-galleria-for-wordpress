Simple Galleria for WordPress is a jQuery image gallery based on WordPress native galleries. You just need to associate some photos to your posts and to use the [gallery] shortcode.

2. Create a post or a page
3. Click on the 'media' button and upload some photos with the WordPress uploader
4. Enter the [gallery] shortcode inside your content. More info about the gallery shortcode here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode
5. That's it
6. If you want to customize the appearance, go to settings > Simple Galleria

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The WordPress gallery works but the slideshow doesn't appear? =

- You may have a conflict with another javascript plugin. Try to disable your plugins one by one.
- Check that you don't load jQuery in footer with another plugin

= How to use the shortcode? =

You just need to put [gallery] inside your content. More info here http://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode

= Why the appearance of the box suddenly changed after the update? =

I had to remove Fancybox from this plugin because the 2.0 version of this library is no longer under the GPL Licence.
I had to use jQuery Colorbox instead which is similar.
If you need to go back to the previous version, please visit my blog at this page: http://benjamin-niess.fr/where-is-my-simple-galleria-for-wordpress-plugin/

= How can I add a custom po/mo translation file =

Create your translation file from the sgfw-default.po one and replace "default" by your country code (eg. sgfw-us_US.po)
Paste the po and mo file into your wp-content/languages/plugins/ folder
